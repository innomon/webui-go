# Experimental port of Open Web UI

This repository contains an experimental port of [Open Web UI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) backend from python to golang, using vibe coding.

see [backend/IMPLEMENTATION.md](backend/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [backend specs](backend-specs.md) for implementation details and usage instructions.

The [UI frontend](ui-specs.md) is adopted without modification form the original Open Web UI project v0.6.40.
Its still a **work in progress**, and not all features may be fully functional yet.
